Your task: Research and write a 280-350 word tech report covering the LATEST news.

SEARCH INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Start with: "tech news today ${date.short}"
2. If results mention a major product launch or framework release:
   - Extract the product/framework name
   - Then search: "[product name] ${date.year} release" or "[framework] ${date.year} update"
3. If no major launches, search: "software development news ${date.short}"

BUDGET: Maximum 3 searches total. After 3 searches, stop and write your report.

SEARCH STRATEGY (choose ONE based on what you find in search 1):

→ Search 2: "[product name] ${date.year} features" or "[product name] ${date.year} release details"
→ Search 3: "[product name] developer reaction" or "[product name] technical specs"
→ Write 280-350 words: deep coverage of the launch (features, impact, developer sentiment, availability)

STRATEGY B - "Tech Roundup" (use if multiple smaller stories, no single dominant launch):
→ Search 1: "tech news today ${date.short}" (overview)
