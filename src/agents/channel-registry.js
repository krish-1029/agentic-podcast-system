2. Check for releases: "programming language releases ${date.month} ${date.year}" or "framework updates ${date.short}"
3. If needed: "developer tools news ${date.short}" or "tech industry news ${date.month} ${date.year}"

Priority Focus Areas (search for TODAY'S news first):
- TODAY'S product launches, releases, or updates
- BREAKING tech industry news and acquisitions
- LATEST programming language releases or major updates
- FRESH framework updates (React, Vue, Node.js, Python, etc.)

CRITICAL DATE CONTEXT: Today is ${date.full}.

Research and provide a comprehensive 280–350 word report on the LATEST Formula 1 news and developments happening RIGHT NOW. Include dates, session names (FP/Quali/Race), and sources. Write clearly and unambiguously so a planner cannot misinterpret facts.

TEMPORAL ACCURACY IS CRITICAL:
- Distinguish between PAST events (already happened) and CURRENT/UPCOMING events
- If a race happened last weekend, it's PAST - don't talk about it as if it's happening now
- Focus on what's happening THIS WEEK or UPCOMING, not what already happened
- Always verify dates in search results before reporting

SEARCH STRATEGY - Use date-specific searches:
1. First search: "Formula 1 news today ${date.short}" or "F1 latest news ${date.month} ${date.year}"
2. Check for current race weekend: "F1 race weekend ${date.short}" or "Formula 1 qualifying results ${date.short}" or "Formula 1 practice results ${date.short}"
3. If no race weekend: "F1 driver news ${date.short}" or "Formula 1 team updates ${date.month} ${date.year}"
4. Avoid searches like "Austin Grand Prix" or "United States Grand Prix" without dates - these might return old results

Priority Focus Areas (search for TODAY'S news first):
- CURRENT race weekend activities (practice, qualifying, race results if happening THIS WEEKEND)
- LATEST driver news from this week (transfers, injuries, statements)
- RECENT team announcements and developments
- CURRENT championship implications and standings changes
- THIS WEEK'S penalties, decisions, or controversies
- UPCOMING race weekend preview (if next race is soon)
- BREAKING technical or regulatory news
- FRESH rumors and paddock talk

${customRequests.length > 0 ? `\nUser's specific interests: ${customRequests.join(', ')}` : ''}

IMPORTANT: 
- You have a budget of 3 web searches maximum. Use date-specific search terms.
- ALWAYS check dates in search results - don't report past events as current
- If a race happened last weekend, mention it as "last weekend's race" not "this weekend's race"
- When reporting race results, always specify the date: "Last weekend's Austin GP" or "This weekend's Mexico City GP"
- Focus on what's happening NOW or UPCOMING, not what already happened

RESEARCH BUDGET:
- Perform up to 3 searches and up to 1 article scrape if needed.
- After you hit the budget or have enough to report, synthesize immediately without further tool use.
